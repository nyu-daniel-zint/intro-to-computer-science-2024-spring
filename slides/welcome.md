template: know-knew

## Data types

Programs usually think of data in terms of rigid stereotypes.

- integers
- floating point numbers
- booleans
- strings
- lists
- dictionaries/hash tables/associative arrays
- nonetypes/null/nil

Review [data types](https://nyu-python-programming.github.io/course-material/data-types).

---

template: know-knew

## Input and output

There are many ways to input and output data from / to external sources.

```python
response = input("What's brown and sticky?")
```

```python
print("'{}' is correct!".format(response.capitalize()))
```

Review [input and output](https://nyu-python-programming.github.io/course-material/input-output).

---

template: know-knew

## Boolean logic and decision-making

Programs can adapt to context.

```python
if this or that and the_other is not also_that:
    thats_wonderful()
```

Review [boolean logic](https://nyu-python-programming.github.io/course-material/boolean-logic) and [decision-making](https://nyu-python-programming.github.io/course-material/decision-making).

---

template: know-knew

## Functions

Functions are modular blocks of code usually designed to perform a single task.

```python
def thats_wonderful():
    print("That's wonderful")
```

Review [functions](https://nyu-python-programming.github.io/course-material/functions).

---

# What you know you knew

## Modules

A module is a simply a reusable library of code.

```python
# import random module
import random

def thats_wonderful():
    # use a function from the random module
    if random.randint(1,10) > 5:
        print("That's wonderful")
    else:
        print("Okay...")
```

Review [modules](https://nyu-python-programming.github.io/course-material/modules).

---

# What you know you knew

## For loop and while loops

You have choices when repeating blocks of code.

```python
for i in range(10):
    print("Welcome!")
```

```python
i = 0
while i < 10:
    print("Welcome!")
    i = i + 1
```

Review [for loops](https://nyu-python-programming.github.io/course-material/loops-for) and [while loops](https://nyu-python-programming.github.io/course-material/loops-while).

---

# What you know you knew

## Lists

Lists are useful for storing a set of related values.

```python
favorite_foods = [
    "Pizza with glyphosate-coated bleached wheat flour and soy cheese",
    "Coffee with GMO corn syrup solids added",
    "Emulsified non-fat sugar-free ice cream with artificial sweetener"
    ]
```

Review [lists](https://nyu-python-programming.github.io/course-material/list-basics) and [more lists](https://nyu-python-programming.github.io/course-material/list-more).

---

# What you know you knew

## Dictionaries

Dictionaries contain key/value pairs.

```python
phone_numbers: {
    "Foo Barstein": "646-888-5623",
    "Baz Foo":      "212-717-3297",
    "Bar Baz":      "747-211-8451"
}
```

---

# What you know you knew

## Text files

Data can be stored and retrieved from text files.

```python
# open file in read mode
f = open('data.csv', 'r')
```

```python
# print out each line of the file
for line in f:
    data = line.split(",")
```

Review [text files](https://nyu-python-programming.github.io/course-material/text-files).

---

# What you know you knew

## Strings

Languages offer many ways to analyze and manipulate text data.

```python
text = "This,That,The other"
text = text.lower()
pos = text.find(",")
if pos > 0:
    data = text.split(",")
```

Review [strings](https://nyu-python-programming.github.io/course-material/string-basics) and [string formatting](https://nyu-python-programming.github.io/course-material/string-formatting).

## Variables, literals, expressions, and function calls

There are many ways to express value in programs.

```python
"I am literally a literal"
```

```python
I_am_not
```

```python
math.pow(washington, 2) + park
```

Review [variables, literals, and expressions](https://nyu-python-programming.github.io/course-material/variables-literals-expressions).

---

# What you didn't know you knew

## Dot notation

Dots indicate belongingness.

random.randint(5, 10)
```

```python
math.pow(2, 2)
```

```python
'help me'.islower()
```

---

# What you didn't know you knew

## Other languages

Try to convince me that you don't understand this code:

```javascript
let x = 5;
let y = true;
if (x < 10 and y == true) {
    console.log("Easy peasy!");
}
```

```java
int x = 5;
boolean y = true;
if (x < 10 and y == true) {
    System.out.println("Easy peasy!");
}
```

# What you knew you didn't know

A popular way to think about programs with interacting parts.

- Object-oriented programming

```python
you = new Student("Jane Doe")
```

```python
me = new Professor("Foo Barstein")
```

```python
me.say_hello(you)
```

```python
x = 5
y = x
x = 10
print(y)
```

Try it out yourself.

---

# What you didn't know you didn't know

## Raw strings

# What to do now

## Download and JDK version 8

The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a necessary set of tools that help develop Java programs. Install the Standard Edition (SE). We use the older version 8 because it is compatible with [Processing](https://processing.org), which we will use later in this course, whereas Processing is not compatible with newer versions of the JDK.

https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java8

---

# What to do now

## Download and install Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that integrates with the JDK to allow you to easily write and debug Java programs.

https://code.visualstudio.com

---

# What to do now

## Download and install the Extension Pack for Java

These extensions to Visual Studio Code make it suitable for Java programming.

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack

---

# What to do now

## Install Git

Get git [for Mac](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/).

- Git for Windows additionally comes with Git Bash, which gives Windows users a UNIX-like command shell.
- WINDOWS USERS - you should use Git Bash or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) rather than Windows' default Powershell or other command line shell program. To set Git Bash or WSL as the default terminal shell within Visual Studio Code, you can try to follow the instructions in [the second answer here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42606837/how-do-i-use-bash-on-windows-from-the-visual-studio-code-integrated-terminal) by **Mahade Walid** and edited by **FruityOatyBar** (ignore the first answe, which is outdated).
- Mac users already have a UNIX command shell in the Terminal app.

- Welcome!

--

- Start to think like a compiler... or is it an interpreter... or an assembler?

--

```python
print("There's no reason to worry... {}".format("yet!"))
```
