# Overview

--

## Concept

The flow of a program can be controlled such that it deviates from its '_normal_' path.

--

- What is a program's 'normal' path?

--

- By default, a program will execute statements in the order written, from top to bottom.

--

- Some branches are _unconditional_ - the control will always break out of this sequential flow every time the program is executed.

--

- Other branches are _conditional_ - certain contextual conditions must be met if the control of the program is to break out of its usual flow.

--

- Conditional branches are our focus here.

---

# Flow Charts

--

## Concept

Understanding the flow of a program's control can be visualized easily with diagrams, irrespective of the programming language and code.

--

- Writing code is precarious, laborious, and error-prone.

--

- Creating such flow diagrams can help understand and communicate the problem being solved without such burden.

--

- The [Unified Modeling Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activity_diagram) (UML) has attempted to define the "Activity Diagram" - a standard for how such diagrams should be drawn.

--

- In practice, people often use parts of the UML Activity Diagram style mixed with their own personal styles.

## Example

A virtual card game program randomly picks two cards, from 1 to 11.

- If those two cards add up to 21, the program outputs the text "Blackjack!"
- Otherwise, the program outputs the text, "Maybe next time!"

## UML Activity Diagram Rules

UML Activity Diagrams follow a few basic rules:

--

- program control starts at the top of the diagram and ends at the bottom.

--

- the start point is indicated with just filled circle, the end with a filled circle with a line around it

--

- any process is indicated with an ellipse (or a rounded rectangle)

--

- if any process being diagrammed is so complex it makes the diagram complex and difficult to understand, make a separate activity diagram for that sub-process, and represent it as a single process in this diagram.

--

- any decision point leading to more than one branch is indicated with a diamond shape (also called a rhombus)

--

- branches should have simple annotations indicating in what decision context they are followed

name: ifs

# If/Else if/Else

--

## Isolated ifs

_if_ statements on their own either execute a particular branch or not.

```java
int card1 = (int) (Math.random() * 11) + 1; // number from 1 to 11
int card2 = (int) (Math.random() * 11) + 1; // number  from 1 to 11

if (card1 + card2 == 21) {
    // if the cards add up to 21...
    System.out.println("Blackjack!");
}
```

---

template: ifs
name: ifs-2

## Binary choice

_if_ statements followed by _else_ blocks can have control flow into one of two branches, depending on a single condition being met or not.

```java
int card1 = (int) (Math.random() * 11) + 1; // number from 1 to 11
int card2 = (int) (Math.random() * 11) + 1; // number  from 1 to 11

if (card1 + card2 == 21) {
    // if the cards add up to 21...
    System.out.println("Blackjack!");
}
else {
    // otherwise...
    System.out.println("Maybe next time!");
}
```

---

name: ifs-3

## n-ary

_if_ statements followed by one or more _else if_ blocks can have control flow into one of several different branches, depending on multiple conditions.

```java
int card1 = (int) (Math.random() * 11) + 1; // number from 1 to 11
int card2 = (int) (Math.random() * 11) + 1; // number  from 1 to 11

if (card1 + card2 == 21) {
    // if the cards add up to 21...
    System.out.println("Blackjack!");
}
else if (card1 == 1 && card2 == 1) {
    // otherwise if the cards are both ones...
    System.out.println("Snake eyes!");
}
else {
    // otherwise...
    System.out.println("Maybe next time!");
}
```

name: switch-case

# Switch/Case

--

## Concept

In Java, an alternative to if/else if/else statements is switch/case statements.

--

- these can be easier to read and write in particular situations.

--

- such as when the branch followed depends upon the value of a single variable

--

- and when multiple conditions lead to the same branch

---

## Example

Imagine a program that recommends how to dress.

![UML activity diagram for weather program](../files/selections_switch_weather.png)

---

template: switch-case
name: switch-case-6

## Not using switch / case

This could be handled by if/else if/else statements with some boolean operators thrown in.

```java
Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);
String weather = scn.nextLine();

if ( weather.equals("very sunny") || weather.equals("raining") ) {
    // if it's raining or very sunny...
	System.out.println("Take an umbrella");
}
else if (weather.equals("snowing") ) {
    // otherwise, if it's snowing...
	System.out.println("Wear a hat!");
}
else {
    // otherwise...
	System.out.println("Good luck!");
}
```

## Using switch / case

Using switch/case would remove the need for boolean operations and provide more readable code.

```java
Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);
String weather = scn.nextLine();

switch (weather) {
    case "raining":
    case "very sunny":
        // if it's raining or very sunny...
        System.out.println("Take an umbrella!");
        break;
    case "snowing":
        // otherwise, if it's snowing...
        System.out.println("Wear a hat!");
        break;
    default:
        // otherwise...
        System.out.println("Good luck!");
}
```

---

name: ternary

# The Ternary Operator

--

## Concept

It is often the case that we use if/else statements to control setting the value of a variable.

```javascript
if (breakfastWasServed && breakfastWasEaten) {
  satiationLevel = "full";
} else {
  satiationLevel = "hungry";
}
```

--

The ternary operator, `?`, thankfully allows us to simplify such syntax:

--

```javascript
satiationLevel = breakfastWasServed && breakfastWasEaten ? "full" : "hungry";
```

# Conclusions

--

You now have a basic understanding of UML activity diagrams, if/else if/else statements, and switch/case statements.

- Thank you. Bye.
